# Important

## Discord Bot and Hosting Clarification

Before proceeding with the integration process, it's crucial to understand key details about our Gmod Integraiton in relation to Discord bot hosting. Please note that our Discord bot isn't directly hosted on your GMod server. Instead, it functions by leveraging the API offered by Gmod Integration.

**Functionality Overview:**

- The Gmod Integration Discord bot and your GMod server are distinct entities.
- The bot utilizes Gmod Integration's API to establish seamless communication and synchronization between Discord and Garry's Mod.
- Acting as an intermediary, the API ensures effective integration and efficient data transfer.

## Potential Security Issue: Infrastructure Compromise

In the unfortunate event that our infrastructure or services are compromised, it's essential to consider the potential far-reaching consequences, such as unauthorized access to servers. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to our infrastructure, they might potentially exploit this to gain root access to servers utilizing Gmod Integration. This could lead to significant security risks, including data breaches, server manipulation, and other malicious activities.

We take the security of our infrastructure seriously and implement robust measures to prevent unauthorized access. However, it's important to recognize that no system can be entirely immune to determined attackers. We encourage server administrators to stay vigilant, keep their systems up-to-date with security patches, and monitor for any unusual activities.

We are committed to promptly addressing any security incidents and continuously improving our security practices to safeguard against such threats.

## Data Privacy and Security

We place a strong emphasis on data privacy and security. We acknowledge the sensitivity of information exchanged during the integration process, and we maintain strict privacy protocols to safeguard your data.

For comprehensive insights into data usage, storage, and our unwavering commitment to preserving your data's security, please consult our [Privacy Policy](https://gmod-integration.com/privacy).
