# Install GWSockets

GWSocket is a WebSocket client for Garry's Mod. It allows you to connect to WebSocket servers and send / receive messages.

## Installation

1. Determine your server's architecture ( Linux or Windows ) and with that the architecture of the server's operating system ( 32-bit or 64-bit ) than download the appropriate version of the module from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/FredyH/GWSockets/releases).
2. Create a folder in your server's `garrysmod/lua` directory called `bin` if it doesn't already exist. (Some hosts may not allow you to create folders in this directory, in which case you will need to contact your host to have them create it for you.)
3. Place the downloaded dll file in the `garrysmod/lua/bin` directory.
4. Everything is set up and ready to go!
