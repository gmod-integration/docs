# After Installation

Congratulations, you have successfully added the bot to your server. You can follow this steps to setup the bot.

Now that you have the bot on your server, you can follow this steps to setup the bot.

## Activate the verification system

The verification system is a system that allows you to verify your players on your discord server. When a new member join your discord server, he will receive a message and he will need to link his steam account to his discord account to be able to see the rest of the server, and receive the roles. This will create a not-verifed role on your server and give it to all members that are not verified and new members. For more information about the verification system, you can go to the [verification system](/category/tutorial) page.

1. Go to your discord server and type `/verify <#channel-id>` if you don't have a verification channel, the bot will create one for you ![verify_command](https://i.imgur.com/5Z3ZQ8Z.png)
2. You should see a message like this ![verify_command_sucess](https://i.imgur.com/5Z3ZQ8Z.png)
