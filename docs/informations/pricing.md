# Pricing

## Why a premium version ?

We are a very small team, we are only 2 developper and we have a lot of work to do. We are working on the service, the panel, the website, the documentation, the support, the discord, etc... We are working on the service on our free time, we are not paid for that. We are working on the service because we love it and we want to make it better. But we have to pay the server, the domain, etc... That's why we have a premium version of our service. The premium version is unlimited, you can have unlimited server, status ect... The free version is limited, you can see the difference between the 2 version on the table below.
